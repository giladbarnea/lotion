`Version: 0.04` 

# Introduction

Welcome! This is an unofficial version of `Notion.so` electron app. Since NotionHQ is busy doing other amazing feature developments, Linux is low on its priority. Here is the tweet from them explaining that

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey we don&#39;t want to release on platforms that we cannot ensure the quality â€“ the team is still small and we don&#39;t use Linux ourselves </p>&mdash; Notion (@NotionHQ) <a href="https://twitter.com/NotionHQ/status/912737143327301634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2017</a></blockquote>


So I decided to build my own app using `nativefier` 

Here is how it looks

# Installation
Download setup script
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetsl/lotion/master/setup.sh 
# Or
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puneetsl/lotion/master/setup.sh > setup.sh

# Run (with sudo for global installation, without sudo for local installation)
[sudo] ./setup.sh install
# Or for native installation
[sudo] ./setup.sh install_native
```
Or simply clone this repo and run

If you would like to install the native (offline) version, run:

If the script has errors or you would like to install
manually, you can refer to [these](https://github.com/puneetsl/lotion/issues/1) instructions.
